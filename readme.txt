Add code format button to the rich text area toolbar in the block editor.

== Description ==
Although the new block editor has built-in code format for marking up inline code, it lacks dedicated button on the rich editor toolbar, and the shortcuts is hard to use in some environments. This plugin adds the code button to the toolbar and changes the shortcut to Ctrl+D (Cmd+D on Mac).

== Installation ==
Clone this repo or download it as ZIP file and upload it to the `plugins` directory of your WordPress installation.
